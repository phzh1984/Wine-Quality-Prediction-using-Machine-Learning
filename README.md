# Wine-Quality-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning

This repository contains code for predicting the quality of Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wines based on physicochemical properties using machine learning techniques.

Objective

The primary goal is to predict wine quality based on the provided physicochemical features. The dataset allows for a classification or regression approach, with quality ratings considered as ordered classes.

Dataset Information

The dataset comprises red and white variants of Vinho Verde wine. It includes physicochemical inputs and sensory output variables. Please refer to [Cortez et al., 2009] for detailed information about the dataset.

Input Variables:

Fixed acidity

Volatile acidity

Citric acid

Residual sugar

Chlorides

Free sulfur dioxide

Total sulfur dioxide

Density

pH

Sulphates

Alcohol

Output Variable:

Quality (score between 0 and 10)
